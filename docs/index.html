<h1>Multi-stage CI/CD Pipeline</h1>

<p>
    The main purpose of a CI/CD pipeline is to automate the process of building, testing, and preparing code for deployment whenever new changes are introduced.
    This helps identify errors early, ensures code quality, and makes development more efficient and reliable.
</p>

<p>In this project, the pipeline follows these stages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Retrieves the latest code from the repository to ensure the workflow uses the most up-to-date version.</li>
    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Configures the correct Go environment so that the application can be built and tested properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Build:</strong> Uses <code>go build</code> inside the <code>outyet/</code> directory to compile the code and verify that it can run without syntax errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Test:</strong> Runs <code>go test</code> to check that all functions behave as expected and that the logic remains correct after any changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Upload:</strong> If the build is successful, the resulting binary is uploaded as an artifact for future use (e.g., deployment or review).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This type of automation reduces manual effort, minimizes the risk of human error, and speeds up the development workflow by giving quick feedback on every change.
